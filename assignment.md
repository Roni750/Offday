# Web Development Intern Recruitment Test: Vacation Management Interface

## Objective
Develop a web application to manage vacation requests.

The application must include two user interfaces:

1. **Requester Interface**: Allows employees to submit vacation requests.
2. **Validator Interface**: Allows managers to review, approve, or reject requests.

The project must use:
- **Vue.js** for the frontend
- **Node.js** for the backend
- A **PostgreSQL** relational database with **TypeORM**
- A modern CSS framework such as **Tailwind CSS**
- A **Common event framework** https://www.npmjs.com/package/commoneventframework?activeTab=readme

---

# Deliverables

1. A working application running locally, with clear setup instructions.
2. Well-structured and documented code, along with a brief explanation of your approach.
3. A public or private Github /Bitbucket repository.

---

# Requirements

## Authentication

Implement a simple authentication system.

Requirements:
- Login endpoint
- Protected routes
- Role-based access control
- Two roles:
  - Requester
  - Validator

You may use JWT authentication.

Seeded demo users are acceptable.

---

# Requester Interface

## Features

1. A form to submit vacation requests with the following fields:
   - Start Date (required)
   - End Date (required)
   - Reason (optional)

2. A list displaying the user's submitted requests.

3. Request statuses:
   - Pending
   - Approved
   - Rejected

4. Team vacation planning available for two roles.

---

# Validator Interface

## Features

1. A dashboard displaying all vacation requests.

2. Ability to filter requests by:
   - Status
   - User

3. Pagination for request listing.

4. Actions to:
   - Approve a request
   - Reject a request

5. A comment field is required when rejecting a request.

---

# Business Rules

Implement the following validation rules:

1. End date must be after start date.
2. Vacation requests cannot overlap for the same user.
3. Approved requests cannot be modified.
4. Requests in the past are not allowed.
5. A rejected request must contain a rejection comment.
6. Only validators can approve or reject requests.

---

# Backend API (Node.js)

Provide RESTful endpoints for:

1. Authentication
2. Submitting a vacation request
3. Retrieving vacation requests:
   - By user (requester view)
   - All requests (validator view)
4. Approving or rejecting a request

Additional requirements:
- Input validation
- Proper error handling
- RESTful best practices
- Pagination support
- Role-based authorization

---

# Architecture Expectations

The project must demonstrate:

- Clean project structure
- Separation of concerns
- Command/Event-oriented architecture
- Modular backend design
- Reusable frontend components

Examples:
- Commands for actions such as CreateVacationRequestCommand or ApproveVacationRequestCommand
- Events such as VacationRequestApprovedEvent

You may use any implementation approach as long as the architecture is clearly visible.

---

# Database

## Users
- id
- name
- email
- password
- role (Requester / Validator)
- created_at

## VacationRequests
- id
- user_id
- start_date
- end_date
- reason
- status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
- comments
- created_at
- updated_at

---

# Frontend Requirements

- Use Vue Router
- Use Axios for API calls
- Use Tailwind CSS or another modern CSS framework
- Responsive behavior is appreciated but advanced design is not required
- Focus on usability, clarity, and code quality rather than visual creativity

---
